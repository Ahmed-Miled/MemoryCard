# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint and Prettier rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Here we go again with a new project! The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts of using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.
